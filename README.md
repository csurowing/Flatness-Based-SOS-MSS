# Flatness-Based-SOS-MSS

Simulations from paper "Motion Optimization for Musculoskeletal
Dynamics: A Flatness-Based Sum-of-Squares Approach"
by Hanz Richter and Holly Warner

Cleveland State University, Center for Human-Machine Systems, 2019

Requirements: 
-Matlab and Optimization Toolbox (for linprog)
-SOSTOOLS (we used it with the SeDuMi solver)

1) For the basic example with 2 muscles and a 1 dof mass: go to TwoMuscleStudy directory and run TwoMuscleSim.m

2) For the open-loop flatness-based SOS optimization, run SOS_Flatness_OL.m 

3) For the receding-horizon implementation, run testFlatnessRH.m
